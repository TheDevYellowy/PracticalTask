# Mini-games Plugin

### This project will not be maintained, you are free to fork and do whatever with it

## What is this?
This is a plugin for the latest version of minecraft 1.21.11 that adds functionality to create, join, and play different
mini-games that have been developed

## Why was it designed this way?
I wanted to have this project be easily expandable both inside this jar and also via other plugins. That's why there is
a [Game](https://github.com/TheDevYellowy/PracticalTask/tree/master/src/main/java/com/thedevyellowy/practicalTask/games/Game.java#L14) 
class. The different mini-games have to extend this so everything is organised and other classes can expand upon this if needed.
